# Speech to Text Plugin - Extends the editor's text plugin to support dictation using speech
This is a speech to text conversion plugin for lesson content editor. This plugin gives user an ability to speak the content and it will be converted to corresponding text. Whenever a user adds a Text area to the slide, it shows a Mic option next to that text editor. By clicking on it, the recording will be started and clicking once again it will be stopped. Currently, it supports en-GB dialect but can be enhanced for other dialects too.
